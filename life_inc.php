        <h4><b>Life Insurance</b></h4>
        <p>Life Insurance is an agreement or a long-term contract between the life insurer and the policyholder. It
            guarantees compensation on loss of life within the term of the plan, in return for a specified premium. The
            beneficiary/nominee whose
            name has been mentioned in the contract gets a specific sum called sum assured from the insurer, on death of
            the policyholder, within the term of the plan. A Life Insurance Plan gives adequate security to your family
            on an unexpected demise.
            Money can never compensate the loss of a loved one. But, there’s no need for your family to suffer
            financially. You enjoy peace of mind knowing your family is secure.

        <h4><b>Terms of Life Insurance</b></h4>
        <h5><b>Insured:</b></h5>
        <p>This is the person whose life in being insured under the Life Insurance Plan. If the person availing the plan
            is different from the person being insured, the buyer is the proposer of the plan. The proposer must have an
            insurable interest in
            the person being insured under the plan.
        </p>
        <h5><b>Term of the contract:</b></h5>
        <p>This is the time period of the Life Insurance plan or the period when Life Insurance is available. The life
            insurer specifies an upper age limit (maximum age), when the term of the policy ends.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5><b>Terms of Life Insurance</b></h5>
        <p>The payment of sum assured takes place on death of the policyholder or expiry of the policy term. The mode of
            payment of the sum assured is either through a lump sum or in periodic installments. This is specified under
            the contract. Premium
            paid:The premium paid depends on sum assured. Premiums could be monthly, quarterly half-yearly or annually
            and is clearly mentioned in the contract. Some Life Insurance Plans have a single premium paid at the start
            of the plan. A grace
            period is provided for delayed premium payments. You can revive the Life Insurance policy within the time
            frame specified by the Life Insurer, on payment of pending premiums + penalties.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5><b>Bonus in Life Insurance</b></h5>
        <p>Life insurers periodically announce a bonus, as a percentage of the sum assured. This amount is added to the
            sum assured and paid to the policyholder on maturity of the plan. This amount is paid on maturity or in case
            of death within the term
            of the plan, the sum assured + accrued bonus is paid by the insurer.
        </p>

        <h5><b>Types of bonuses under Life Insurance</b></h5>
        <p>Guaranteed Bonus:</p>
        <p>Guaranteed bonus is paid as a percentage of the sum assured. It’s paid for the first few years of the Life
            Insurance Plan, say 5 years. The guaranteed bonus is received at the end of the term of the plan.
            Reversionary Bonus:
        </p>
        <p>An insurer declares a reversionary bonus, if it performs well. This bonus is completely at the discretion of
            the insurer. The bonus is declared after the completion of the guaranteed bonus period and is applicable
            only on participating policies.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h5><b>What is surrender of a Life Insurance Plan?</b></h5>
        <p>If you surrender the Life Insurance Plan before the full term of the plan is completed, you get a portion of
            the money paid in premiums, after certain charges are deducted. If you decide to terminate the Life
            Insurance Plan before maturity,
            the insurer pays you (policyholder), what is known as the surrender value.</p>
        <p>A surrender charge is deducted which varies across Life Insurance Plans. You can surrender traditional Life
            Insurance Plans. These are whole Life Insurance Plans, money back plans or endowment plans. Life insurers
            cannot levy surrender charges
            if you terminate the plan after 5 years as per IRDA rules and guidelines.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h5><b>Types of Surrender Value</b></h5>
        <h5><b>Guaranteed Surrender Value</b></h5>
        <p>You get guaranteed surrender value only after paying at least 2-3 annual premiums. If the premium paying term
            is less than 10 years, your Life Insurance Plan acquires a surrender value after paying two annual premiums.
            If the premium paying
            term is more than 10 years, your Life Insurance Plan acquires a surrender value after paying three annual
            premiums.
        </p>
        <p>If you surrender the Life Insurance Plan after 3 years, the life insurer has to pay at least 30% of the total
            premiums, excluding the premiums paid for the first year. Any additional premium paid for riders and bonus
            that you have received
            from the insurer, is excluded.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>If you terminate the Life Insurance Plan after 4-7 years, you get 50% of premiums paid.
            </li>
            <li>If you surrender the Life Insurance Plan in the last two policy years, you get up to 90% of the premiums
                paid.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h5><b>Special Surrender Value</b></h5>
        <p>This surrender value depends on sum assured, term of the plan, premiums paid on the plan and bonuses. You can
            calculate special surrender value by<br> Special surrender value = Surrender value of the Life Insurance
            Plan = [{(Number of premiums
            paid on the plan / Number of premiums payable on the plan) * Sum Assured of the plan} + Accumulated Bonus on
            the plan] * Surrender Value factor. The Surrender value factor is basically a percentage of Paid-up value +
            bonus.</p>
        <hr>
        <h5><b>Types of Life Insurance Plans</b></h5>
        <h6><b>Term Life Insurance</b></h6>
        <p>Term Life Insurance is pure risk cover. You pay a premium for a sum assured (This is specific cover under the
            plan) for a specific tenure. If the policyholder dies within the term of the plan, nominees get the sum
            assured called death benefit.
            This plan has no survival benefits.
        </p>
        <p>Term Life Insurance Plans have low premiums as they are pure risk plans. They offer protection only in the
            event of death. These plans have no maturity value.
        </p>

        <p>The 3 key factors of Term Life Insurance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sum Assured
            </li>
            <li>Premium to be paid by the insured
            </li>
            <li>Term of coverage<br> These factors define a term Life Insurance Plan. The term can be a year or more
                than one year. The premium may be constant or could change with time. The policy holder’s life is
                insured for a specific term. If the
                policyholder dies within the term of the plan, nominees get the death benefit. Term life plans have no
                survival benefits.
            </li>
