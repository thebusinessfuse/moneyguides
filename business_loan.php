        <h3>Business Loan</h3>
        <p>Your business requires working capital to run and function smoothly. Lack of funds may sabotage the ambitious
            growth plans of your business. Banks give you money to run your business, which you have to repay with
            interest, called a Business
            loan. A business loan is a loan that is availed for purely business purposes. The principal amount along
            with interest is to be repaid according to the terms and conditions of the business loan.
        </p>
        <p>There are different types of business loans like secured loans, unsecured loans, microloans and so on.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your business loan can be secured (you give a collateral) such as your company inventory, land or
                machinery and avail your loan at a lower rate of interest.
            </li>
            <li>Your business loan can be unsecured (you do not need to give a collateral). You are charged a higher
                rate of interest.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

            <h5>What is Business/Commercial Loan?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The main aim of a commercial loan is to help traders, businessman and professionals, start or expand
                    their commercial activities. Such loans can be secured or unsecured. Loan amounts ranging from Rs.
                    5, 00,000 to Rs.1, 00, 00,000.
                    The tenure of repayment can be up to 10 years.
                </li>
                <li>Secured business loan: secured business loans means that the entrepreneur keeps something as
                    collateral against the loan amount taken. Collateral can be anything from raw material to finished
                    products, land and building of the business
                    to plant and machinery. If you have the collateral for the cash advance, you can have the money at
                    relatively cheap rates and with much more flexible repayment options.
                </li>
                <li>Unsecured business loan: unsecured business loan, as the name explains is a type of loan that
                    doesnâ€™t require collateral. It is typically at a higher rate of interest and is taken for a
                    comparatively smaller tenure.
