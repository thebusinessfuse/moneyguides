                        <li>The main aim of a commercial loan is to help traders, businessman and professionals, start
                            or expand
                            their commercial activities. Such loans can be secured or unsecured. Loan amounts ranging

                        <li>Secured business loan: secured business loans means that the entrepreneur keeps something as
                            collateral against the loan amount taken. Collateral can be anything from raw material to
                            finished
                            products, land and building of the business
                            to plant and machinery. If you have the collateral for the cash advance, you can have the
                            money at
                            relatively cheap rates and with much more flexible repayment options.

                            comparatively smaller tenure.
