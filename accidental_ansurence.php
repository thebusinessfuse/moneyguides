        <h3>Accidental Insurance Plan</h3>
        <p>You have just finished your meeting at office and rushing home for an early dinner is your main priority. You
            are riding your two wheeler looking carefully for those potholes and another vehicle hits you from behind.
            You are rushed to the
            hospital and find you have a fractured leg. No work for the next few months and no pay. Worse, those hefty
            medical bills. It is now too late to avail a personal accident plan but yes better late than never. You can
            meet with an accident
            again and this time you are armed with a personal plan.
        </p>
        <h3>What is Accidental Insurance Plan?</h3>
        <p>An accident is an uncertain, unplanned event, it just happens. Soaring medical costs and quality time lost
            due to not being able to work, prove to be very costly. An accidental insurance comes into the picture in
            case of accidents. An accident
            may get a person partially or totally disabled, impacting his earning capabilities. An accidental insurance
            plan covers the insured in case of an accident. Accidental Insurance does not cover suicide, self-injury,
            armed force operations,
            war and so on.

        </p>

        <h3>Features of Accidental Insurance Plan</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Accidental insurance must be renewed each year. It can be renewed every year, just like a Term Insurance
                and Accidental Insurance Plan.
            </li>
            <li>Maximum sum insured depends upon the insurer. Based on your income, some insurers offer 60-100 times
                your monthly income. Others offer 8 to 10 times your yearly income as a sum insured.
            </li>
            <li>Few insurers provide accidental insurance to dependents, but have limitations vis-à-vis sum assured.
            </li>
            <li>Currently there are no income tax benefits of availing Personal Accidental Insurance. However, the claim
                amount you receive is not taxable.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Benefits of Accidental Insurance Plan</h3>
        <p>Accidental insurance is generally the last policy which people think of. While health insurance covers the
            insured’s unexpected hospitalization costs, term insurance helps take care of family’s financial needs in
            case of the insured’s demise.
            Term insurance doesn’t provide financial assistance in case the insured is disables fully, temporarily or
            permanently. Accident insurance has the following benefits:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Life insurance policies offer accident riders. However, these are limited to permanent disability or a
                basic cover for accidental death up to a certain extent of the sum assured. A standalone personal
                accident policy covers you for all
                losses including temporary disablement, income loss and hospitalization.</li>
            <li>The insurer will pay the insured’s family, in case the insured dies in an accident. The nominee gets
                100% of the sum assured.</li>
            <li>A permanent partial disability may result in loss of speech, eyesight, loss of a toe or fingers. The
                insured receives a percentage of the sum assured for a specific time period, or as a lump sum payment.
            </li>
            <li>In case of a permanent total disability, the nominee is entitles to make a claim for the total sum
                assured.
            </li>
            <li>In case of a temporary total disability like a fracture, the insurer provides a daily or weekly benefit.
            </li>
        </ul>
