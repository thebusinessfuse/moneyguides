        <h3>Tax Planning</h3>
        <p>Tax planning means analyzing your financial situation, from the point of view of tax efficiency. It helps a
            taxpayer employ tax exemptions, deductions and benefits to minimize tax liability and optimize finances. Tax
            planning is different
            from Tax Evasion. Tax Planning is legal, whereas tax evasion is not. Tax planning aims at availing tax
            benefits through legitimate means on the lines of provisions and relaxations provided in tax laws.

            <h5>Tax Planning tips in India</h5>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Defer Income: </b>Deferring income is a good strategy to save tax. Deferring income means
                    postponing your income to a future time. By deferring your income, you can claim deductions now,
                    when tax rates are higher. These investments
                    would mature in the future, when rates might be lower. So, you will gain today as well as in the
                    future
                </li>


                <li><b>Pay off expenses on time: </b>Pay off your expenses on time. This allows you to claim tax
                    deductions and also save tax. Remember to record all the expenses that you make, so that you do not
                    forget to claim them. Deductions on expenses
                    like insurance premiums can only be claimed in the previous year after the payment is made.
                </li>


                <li><b>Plan your charity: </b>Yes, charity should be selfless, but that doesn’t mean you cannot avail
                    tax benefits on charitable activities. If you think your taxable income is simply too much, plan to
                    give some in charity. Then, claim
                    deduction on the same and save tax!
                </li>


                <li><b>Make it a continuous process: </b>Tax planning should not be a one-time activity. You have a
                    whole year to plan your expenses, investments and taxes. Therefore, keep monitoring your finances
                    and tax planning strategies. If you find
                    some aspects of your tax planning are going out of hand, you have time to fix the issue well in
                    advance, rather than pay a fortune in tax or penalties.
                </li>

                <li><b>Life Insurance Plans:</b> Avail Life Insurance Plans to save tax. They have dual benefits; you
                    save tax in the form of premium payments and your life is insured. Be sure to buy a life insurance
                    plan that suits your needs. Both life
                    insurance plans (term or endowment), enjoy tax deductions up to Rs 1.5 lakhs a year under Section 80
                    C, on the premiums paid.
                </li>


                <li><b>Invest in Tax Saving Instruments:</b>You may invest in PPF, ELSS, NSC, 5 year tax saver FDs and
                    other tax saving instruments to save tax. If you have a girl child, you open a Sukanya Samriddhi
                    Yojana (SSY) account in her name and
                    make regular contributions to save tax.
                </li>

            <h5>Importance of Tax Planning</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>Tax exemptions, deductions and a rebate can be claimed up to the date of filing income tax returns.
                </li>
                <li>Tax planning saves you from severe penal consequences, as the law reduces the scope of tax
                    avoidance.
                </li>
                <li>The Government provides incentives through tax laws, encouraging citizens to save tax.
                </li>
                <li>Tax planning ensures that you plan your expenses well. For companies, it helps in capital budgeting,
                    sales promotion and so on.
                </li>
                <li>When interest rates are high, the amount saved in the form of taxes is as good as an interest-free
                    loan from the Government.
                </li>
                <li>Companies can claim repairs, renewals, depreciation on Plant and Machinery and also deduct business
                    expenses, giving them more money to invest in the business.
                </li>
                <li>Tax planning can reduce taxable income and capital gains. It gives you a clear picture of your
                    savings, investments and pensions.
                </li>
                <li>Tax planning can help with estate planning. Many investments need investors to mention a beneficiary
                    or a nominee. This ensures that your assets pass directly to your heirs.
