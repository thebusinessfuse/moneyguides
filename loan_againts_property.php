                    <ul>
                        <li>The bank allows you to avail a loan against property (on your house), as this is a
                            secured loan (your
                            house/property is the collateral) The bank has a due diligence process (the bank
                            appraises your
                            house/property and assesses its value).</li>
                        <li>You
                            are sanctioned a loan up to 60-70% of the value of your property.</li>
                        <li> The bank charges you an interest of around
                            12-16% for a loan against property.</li>
                        <li>This is much less than the interest rates charged for a personal loan.</li>
                        <li>The tenure of the loan
                            against property is around 10 years.</li>
                        <li>You can mortgage a self-occupied property or a piece of land that you
                            own.</li>
                        <li>The property must be free from mortgage or any kind of litigation.</li>
                        <li>You can avail a loan against
                            property only if the property
                            title is clear.</li>
                        <li> As loan against property (LAP) has long repayment tenure, many citizens who need money
                            avail
                            this loan, as it doesnâ€™t pose much of a burden. Loan against property offers flexible
                            repayment and low
                            interest rates.</li>

            <h5>Loan against property eligibility criteria</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The title of the property needs to be clear and marketable. Your bank lends an amount equal to about
                    50-60% of the value of the pledged property.</li>

                <li>Architects, chartered accountants, cost accountants, company secretaries, doctors, engineers,
                    dentists and top management professionals can easily avail loan against property.</li>

                <li>You can avail loan against property for self-occupied residential properties or even if you have
                    rented it out to a tenant. LAP can be availed against an empty plot of land. </li>

                <li>If you are salaried, you need to have a minimum age of 21-24 years and your maximum age can be
                    around 60 years at maturity of the loan. </li>

                <li>If you are self employed, your maximum age can be 65 years at the maturity of the loan.</li>

                <li>You need to have a minimum work experience of 1-5 years if you are salaried, and you need to be in
                    business for at least 2-5 years if you are self employed.</li>

                <li>Past credit history plays a very important role in getting your loan against property sanctioned.
                </li>

                <li>The CIBIL score plays a very important part and if youâ€™re past credit history is poor, your loan is
                    liable to get rejected.</li>

                <li>Loan against property can be availed on land/property which has multiple owners. All co-owners must
                    be co-applicants for the loan.</li>

                <li>Loan against property can be availed against a commercial property.</li>

                <li>If property mortgaged is under-construction, the bank will disburse loan amounts is installments.
                    Interest will be charged only on the amount which has been disbursed. This is called the pre-EMI.
                    After full loan has been disbursed,
                    you have to pay regular EMIâ€™s.</li>
