        <h4>Mutual Fund</h4>
        <p>A mutual fund pools your money along with that of several other investors and invests this money, depending
            on the type of mutual fund you chose. It invests in different stocks if you choose equity or equity
            diversified mutual funds, in bonds
            or fixed income securities, if you choose debt mutual funds and a mix of equity and debt if you choose a
            balanced mutual fund. The company which manages the mutual fund is called an AMC or an asset management
            company. An AMC may manage
            several mutual fund schemes. The money you and several investors invest in the mutual fund is managed by a
            professional called a fund manager, appointed by the AMC. Fees are paid to the fund manager for managing
            your money, which is deducted
            from the money; you invest in the mutual fund. The activities of the AMC are regulated by SEBI (The
            Securities and Exchange Board of India). You have to pay money when you enter and exit a mutual fund scheme,
            called the entry load and
            exit load.

        <h4>How do mutual funds work?</h4>
        <p>A mutual fund is a company that pools several investors’ money and invests this money, depending on the type
            of mutual fund you choose. It may invest in stocks if you choose equity or equity diversified mutual funds
            in bonds or fixed income
            securities if you choose debt mutual funds and a mix of equity and debt if you choose a balanced mutual
            fund. Mutual funds are diversified; so, your investment bears a much lower risk. The company which manages
            the mutual fund is called
            an Asset management Company (AMC). A single AMC may manage several mutual fund schemes. The money that is
            invested in the mutual fund is managed by a professional called a fund manager who is appointed by the AMC.
            A part of the money you
            invest goes in fund management charges to pay the salary of the fund manager. The fund manager buys and
            sells securities so that the fund grows and your investment is maximized. AMCs are regulated by SEBI
            (Securities and Exchange Board
            of India). Mutual funds have an entry and exit loads fees that are applicable when you enter and exit a
            mutual fund scheme.

            <h4 class="text-center"><b>Mutual funds in India can be open ended or close ended</b></h4>
            <p>Open ended schemes: They don’t have a fixed maturity date. Investors can buy and sell units of mutual
                fund, at any time within market trading hours.
            </p>
            <p>Close-ended schemes: Theses schemes are open for investment only for a short period of time. You have to
                invest within this time frame. The close ended schemes are listed on a stock exchange. You can buy and
                sell units on the stock exchange
                through a broker just like stocks. </p>
            <p>Net Asset Value (NAV)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have the total market value of all the assets of the mutual fund portfolio such as cash,
                    securities, shares, bonds, liquid assets, dividends to be received and interest accrued. You have
                    the liabilities, which is money owed to
                    its creditors or investors redeeming their money. There will be certain expenses accrued over time,
                    yet to be paid.
                </li>
                <li>Net Asset Value is basically the difference between these assets and liabilities divided by the
                    outstanding units. The outstanding units are those which are taken up by the investor.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Direct Plan Mutual Funds </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can directly invest in the asset management company. You do not invest through agents and
                    distributors. A mutual fund scheme has to affix the word “DIRECT” in the scheme name.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>SIP in Mutual Fund</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In case of SIP, on a specified date a fixed amount as specified by you is deducted from your bank
                    amount. The amount debited is then invested in a particular mutual fund scheme of your choice, at
                    fixed time periods such as the first
                    day of each month. Many AMC and fund houses provide the online option for your SIP investments.

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Types of Equity Mutual Funds</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Equity Diversified Mutual Funds: The mutual fund looks to invest in a wide variety of companies.
                    These may be small to medium sized companies or even large companies. These companies may be spread
                    across sectors and industries. These
                    may be into oil and gas, pharmaceuticals or infrastructure. Investment across sectors and companies
                    reduces risk in investing.
                </li>
                <li>Sectoral Mutual Funds: A sectoral fund is a mutual fund which basically invests in stocks of a
                    particular sector. It remains focused on the stocks of a particular business. These may be the
                    Technology, Financial Services, Telecommunications,
                    Metals and Mining, Healthcare and Pharma, Real Estate and Infrastructure, Power, Oil and Gas,
                    Shipping, Airline Industry, Banking, FMCG and so on.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Index Schemes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An index fund is basically an equity fund that mirrors or replicates a particular stock market index
                    such as the CNX Nifty 50 or the S&P BSE Sensex. An index fund which tracks the S&P BSE Sensex will
                    invest only in the thirsty stocks
                    which this index comprises of. The proportions of investment in each stock will exactly match with
                    the weight of the stock in the index. All the fund manager has to do is to follow and replicate the
                    index he tracks and invest in
                    all the constituent shares in the same proportion or ratio as the index.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As the name suggests, ELSS invests the whole corpus in equities. Proportions as high as 80-90% in
                    equities are found in an Equity Linked Savings Schemes. It is a special kind of mutual fund that
                    qualifies for tax benefits.
                </li>
                <li>Lock in: ELSS has a 3 year lock in. You cannot touch your money in the ELSS for 3 years.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>ELSS enjoys EEE exemptions</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“EEE” means exempt exempt exempt. The ELSS enjoys a deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax
                    Act, up to INR 1.5 lakhs a year. You can invest a maximum amount of INR 1.5 lakhs a year in ELSS and
                    avail a deduction under Section
                    80C of the Income Tax Act on the full amount invested.

                </li>
                <li>The money accumulates with time (if the value of the ELSS increases) and no tax is charged on this
                    amount. The money you withdraw on maturity after 3 years is tax free.

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Risk in Mutual Funds</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As per SEBI rules the level of risk in a mutual fund is denoted through colors.</li>
                <li>Net Asset Value is basically the difference between these assets and liabilities divided by the
                    outstanding units. The outstanding units are those which are taken up by the investor.</li>
