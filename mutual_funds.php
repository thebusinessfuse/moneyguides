                    index

                    invest only in the thirsty stocks
                    which this index comprises of. The proportions of investment in each stock will exactly match

                    the weight of the stock in the index. All the fund manager has to do is to follow and replicate
                    the
                    index he tracks and invest in
                    all the constituent shares in the same proportion or ratio as the index.
