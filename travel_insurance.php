            <h3>Travel Insurance</h3>
            <p>You book yourself a holiday abroad, or want to travel within the country. You need to insure yourself against a medical emergency while travelling or in the country you are holidaying, loss of baggage, passport and so on. The travel insurance

            <h3>Why Travel Insurance?</h3>
            <p>Medical ailments may force you to cancel your trip, which will result in heavy cancellation penalties. Such scenarios are covered to a certain degree by Travel Insurance. Losses incurred due to missing flights, delays and missed connections.
                Loss of Baggage could create serious issues. Travel Insurance helps in covering the cost of baggage and transport to the intended port. In case baggage is permanently lost, travel insurance will help you cover the necessary costs. Ailments
                suffered during the trip can result in heavy medical bills. Travel Insurance helps tide over such costs. Some Travel Insurance policies help cover the losses incurred if an airline, cruiser or hotel defaults on their commitments. Acts
                of Terrorism or war are also covered by Travel Insurance.
