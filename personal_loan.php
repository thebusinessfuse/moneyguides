                    <ul>
                        <li>A Personal Loan is a loan sanctioned by a lender, without any security (collateral).
                        </li>
                        <li> So, it is an unsecured
                            loan. Personal loans are sanctioned by banks and Non-banking Financial Companies
                            (NBFCs).</li>
                        <li> You don’t need to
                            state any reasons, while
                            availing personal loans.</li>
                        <li>Personal loan is the best loan to fund financial emergencies.</li>
                        <li> It is a great way to
                            address a financial crisis, as it allows the borrower to avail a loan without any
                            conditions.</li>
                        <li> Personal loans
                            are sanctioned rather
                            quickly.</li>
                        <li>They may be approved as quickly as 24-48 hours, after the borrower submits the loan
                            application.</li>
                        <li>Personal loans are availed on the basis of specific criteria, such as level of income,
                            employment history,
                            credit score and scope
                            for repayment.</li>

                <h5 class="text-center"><b>Personal Loan Repayment Tenure</b> </h5>
                <p class="text-center">Personal Loans have flexible repayment tenure. You can choose repayment tenure
                    which matches your
                    repayment
                    ability. Personal Loans have tenure of 1-5 years. The personal loan tenure determines how easily
                    you can
                    make the repayments. </p>

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <h6><b>To choose personal loan tenure decide on:</b> </h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Loan Amount:</b>This is the amount you wish to borrow. Decide personal loan tenure
                            based on the size
                            of the loan. Longer personal loan tenure means lesser monthly repayment amounts. You end
                            up paying more
                            interest over personal loan
                            tenure. Shorter personal loan tenure means higher monthly repayment amounts. You end up
                            paying less
                            interest over the personal loan tenure.</li>
                        <li><b>Personal Loan </b>Interest:Personal Loan interest rate depends on CIBIL score. If you
                            have a good
                            CIBIL score of 700-750 and above, you get personal loan at low interest rates. If you
                            have a bad CIBIL
                            score, bank charges high personal
                            loan interest rate. A very poor CIBIL score means banks won’t sanction personal loan. If
                            banks offer low
                            personal loan interest rates, opt for shorter personal loan tenure. You can easily
                            manage the personal
                            loan EMIs and you
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b> Monthly Budget:</b>If monthly expenses are high and are 50-60% of monthly income,
                            you must opt for
                            longer personal loan tenure to reduce personal loan EMIs. You will end up paying more
                            interest across
                            personal loan tenure. If your
                            salary is hiked or you get a bonus, prepay personal loan tenure. If your salary is hiked
                            or you get a
                            bonus, prepay personal loan to save on interest payments.

                    <ul>
                        <li>APR or Annual Percentage Rate is a reference for all loans including personal loans,
                            credit cards and
                            car loans. APR for personal loan ranges from 11% to 22% a year. The personal loan tenure
                            ranges from 12
                            months to 60 months.
                        </li>
                        <li>You are offered two kinds of personal loan interest rates. They are fixed rates and
                            variable rates.
                            Banks use risk-based pricing method to fix personal loan interest rates. This helps
                            determine risk in
                            lending based on credit score. If
                            the risk is high, APR is high. If the risk is low, APR is low.
                        </li>
                        <li>Banks check credit score before sanctioning personal loans. They also check income,
                            employment status,
                            loan amount and credit report before sanctioning personal loan.
