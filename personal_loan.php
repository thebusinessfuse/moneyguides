        <h4>Personal Loan</h4>
        <p>You may face a financial crisis anytime. You can borrow from family and friends, but it is not wise to
            challenge the cordiality of relationships just for money. Why not borrow from banks instead?
        </p>
        <h4>What is Personal Loan? </h4>
        <p>A Personal Loan is a loan sanctioned by a lender, without any security (collateral). So, it is an unsecured
            loan. Personal loans are sanctioned by banks and Non-banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). You don’t need to
            state any reasons, while
            availing personal loans. Personal loan is the best loan to fund financial emergencies. It is a great way to
            address a financial crisis, as it allows the borrower to avail a loan without any conditions. Personal loans
            are sanctioned rather
            quickly. They may be approved as quickly as 24-48 hours, after the borrower submits the loan application.
            Personal loans are availed on the basis of specific criteria, such as level of income, employment history,
            credit score and scope
            for repayment.

        </p>
        <h4>Personal Loan Repayment Tenure </h4>
        <p>Personal Loans have flexible repayment tenure. You can choose repayment tenure which matches your repayment
            ability. Personal Loans have tenure of 1-5 years. The personal loan tenure determines how easily you can
            make the repayments. </p>

        <p>To choose personal loan tenure decide on: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Loan Amount:</b>This is the amount you wish to borrow. Decide personal loan tenure based on the size
                of the loan. Longer personal loan tenure means lesser monthly repayment amounts. You end up paying more
                interest over personal loan
                tenure. Shorter personal loan tenure means higher monthly repayment amounts. You end up paying less
                interest over the personal loan tenure.</li>
            <li><b>Personal Loan </b>Interest:Personal Loan interest rate depends on CIBIL score. If you have a good
                CIBIL score of 700-750 and above, you get personal loan at low interest rates. If you have a bad CIBIL
                score, bank charges high personal
                loan interest rate. A very poor CIBIL score means banks won’t sanction personal loan. If banks offer low
                personal loan interest rates, opt for shorter personal loan tenure. You can easily manage the personal
                loan EMIs and you
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Monthly Budget:</b>If monthly expenses are high and are 50-60% of monthly income, you must opt for
                longer personal loan tenure to reduce personal loan EMIs. You will end up paying more interest across
                personal loan tenure. If your
                salary is hiked or you get a bonus, prepay personal loan tenure. If your salary is hiked or you get a
                bonus, prepay personal loan to save on interest payments.

            </li>

        </ul>
        <h4>APR of Personal Loan </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>APR or Annual Percentage Rate is a reference for all loans including personal loans, credit cards and
                car loans. APR for personal loan ranges from 11% to 22% a year. The personal loan tenure ranges from 12
                months to 60 months.
            </li>
            <li>You are offered two kinds of personal loan interest rates. They are fixed rates and variable rates.
                Banks use risk-based pricing method to fix personal loan interest rates. This helps determine risk in
                lending based on credit score. If
                the risk is high, APR is high. If the risk is low, APR is low.
            </li>
            <li>Banks check credit score before sanctioning personal loans. They also check income, employment status,
                loan amount and credit report before sanctioning personal loan.
            </li>
        </ul>

                    fee of 1-2% on personal loan amount.

            <h5>Amortization Schedule </h5>
            <p>Amortization means repaying debt through fixed payment over a specified tenure. An amortization schedule
                is a detailed table of recurring loan payments which show the principal component and interest component
                in the personal loan EMIs.
                Personal Loan EMIs are of the same amount. Earlier instalments comprise of higher interest and lesser
                principal. As each instalments passes, proportion of interest in the EMI reduces and the principal
                portion increases.
