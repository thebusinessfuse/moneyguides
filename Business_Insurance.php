        <p>Business insurance coverage protects businesses from losses due to events that may occur during the normal
            course of business. There are many types of insurance for businesses including coverage for property damage,
            legal liability and employee-related
            risks.</p>

        <h4><b>What is Business Insurance?</b></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Risk is a part and parcel of a business and is unavoidable.</li>
            <li>However certain risks which a business faces can
            be avoided by insuring your business called Business Insurance.</li>
            <li>You pay a premium and insure your business
            for a sum of money called
            Sum Assured.</li>
            <li> Business insurance covers fire and allied perils, loss of company equipment due to theft, third
            party liability if your business causes damage to public property and a professional indemnity cover.</li>

                    <h4><b>Why Business Insurance?</b></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You invest a lot of money in a business. You want to concentrate only on making a profit.
                            You
                            have
                            uncertainty in the business environment which can affect your business. There is nothing you
                            can
                            do
                            about these changes in the business
                            environment. A business also faces risk to its location due to fire, flood or a natural
                            calamity. This
                            is true mainly for a manufacturing unit. Your business might face risk from theft of data by
                            your
                            employees.
                        </li>
                        <li>Maximum sum insured depends upon the insurer. Based on your income, some insurers offer
                            60-100
                            times
                            your monthly income. Others offer 8 to 10 times your yearly income as a sum insured.

                        </li>
                        <li>You would have to pay a lot of money in compensation to your employees injured on duty.

                        </li>
                        <li>The risk due to this uncertainly can be avoided by availing business insurance.
                        </li>

                            <li>Worker’s compensation is a system where the employee is not allowed, by statue, to sue
                                their
                                employer for on-the-job injuries; but, in return, the employer must participate in a
                                system that
                                provides nearly automatic payment to the
                                employee in case of injury for medical bills and damages.
                            </li>
                            <li>There are many options for worker’s compensation coverage.
                            </li>
                            <li>Some states allow an employer to opt-out of the system if the employer is self insured,
                                some run the
                                system through private insurers while others use state agencies.

                            <li>Your personal automobile policy does not cover vehicles used by your business. If your

                                vehicles or anything that is required to be titled by your state, then you need a

                                policy.</li>
                            <li>Commercial auto coverage insures against property damage to vehicles and damage caused
                                to others by
                                those vehicles.

                            <li>Health Insurance to be competitive, most business need to offer their workers health
                                insurance. This
                                insurance offers a health coverage benefit to your employees.

                                disability of key employees. For example, one partner carries a life insurance policy
                                naming the
                                partnership as a beneficiary. If that
                                partner dies, and the business has planned properly, the proceeds of the policy can be
                                used by the
                                business to buy out the share of the decedent’s partnership interest from the estate.

                            <li>Other Insurance or Scripted policies, it could very well be that your business is so

                                need for coverage that is a mixture of some of the coverage listed above or something
                                written
                                specifically for your particular risk.
                                Examples of such scripted insurance are that of some actresses, actors, or sports stars
                                that have
                                had legs insured at some point in their careers.
