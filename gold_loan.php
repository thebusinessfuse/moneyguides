                Key factors to consider for Gold Loan
            </h5>
            <h6>Rural areas</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you reside in a rural area, you can easily avail a gold loan from an NBFC (Non Banking Financial
                    Company).

                </li>
                <li>
                    The documentation is much faster if you avail a gold loan from a NBFC rather than a gold loan from a
                    bank.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Remember: The NBFC charges you a higher rate of interest on the gold loan than a bank. The interest
                    charged by the NBFC could be around 22-24%.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Another benefit you get from availing a gold loan from a NBFC is you have to only pay the interest
                    amounts regularly on the gold loan.

                </li>
                <li>
                    You pay the Principal (Borrowed amount) back, at the end of the term (tenure of the gold loan) and
                    reclaim your pledged gold jewelry.

                </li>
                <li>
                    There are no processing charges and pre payment penalty, if you avail a gold loan from an NBFC.

                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Banks and NBFCs give you loans against loan. Borrowers can pledge gold coins or gold jewelry and
                    avail a gold loan. The purity of gold has to be between 18-24 carats.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gold loan is a product designed to provide liquidity against gold ornaments without having to sell
                    them. Gold ornaments lying idle can be put to better use by availing loan against gold ornaments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gold loan will be sanctioned on submission of all the required documents and satisfactory assessment
                    of gold ornaments. Typically, gold loans have tenure of one year. This can be further extended.
