        <h4>Child Education Plan</h4>

        <p>The best gift parents can give their children is a sound education. Education is an investment which pays the
            best dividends. The roots of education run deep and its fruits last a lifetime. Therefore, Children’s
            Education Planning is an important
            responsibility of parents. It calls for proper financial planning. To provide the best education for
            children, you will have to spend a lot of money. Education is no cheaper. Forget studying abroad, studying
            in India too is very expensive.

        </p>


        <div id="card" style=" padding: 20px; border: 1px solid rgb(219, 209, 209); border-radius: 10px;">
            <h5>What is Accidental Insurance Plan?</h5>
            <p>An accident is an uncertain, unplanned event, it just happens. Soaring medical costs and quality time
                lost due to not being able to work, prove to be very costly. An accidental insurance comes into the
                picture in case of accidents. An
                accident may get a person partially or totally disabled, impacting his earning capabilities. An
                accidental insurance plan covers the insured in case of an accident. Accidental Insurance does not cover
                suicide, self-injury, armed force
                operations, war and so on.

            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>Features of Accidental Insurance Plan</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>Accidental insurance must be renewed each year. It can be renewed every year, just like a Term
                    Insurance and Accidental Insurance Plan.
                </li>
                <li>Maximum sum insured depends upon the insurer. Based on your income, some insurers offer 60-100 times
                    your monthly income. Others offer 8 to 10 times your yearly income as a sum insured.
                </li>
                <li>Few insurers provide accidental insurance to dependents, but have limitations vis-à-vis sum assured.
                </li>
                <li>Currently there are no income tax benefits of availing Personal Accidental Insurance. However, the
                    claim amount you receive is not taxable.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h5>Benefits of Accidental Insurance Plan
            </h5>
            <p>Accidental insurance is generally the last policy which people think of. While health insurance covers
                the insured’s unexpected hospitalization costs, term insurance helps take care of family’s financial
                needs in case of the insured’s
                demise. Term insurance doesn’t provide financial assistance in case the insured is disables fully,
                temporarily or permanently. Accident insurance has the following benefits:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Life insurance policies offer accident riders. However, these are limited to permanent disability or
                    a basic cover for accidental death up to a certain extent of the sum assured. A standalone personal
                    accident policy covers you for
                    all losses including temporary disablement, income loss and hospitalization.
                </li>
                <li>The insurer will pay the insured’s family, in case the insured dies in an accident. The nominee gets
                    100% of the sum assured.
                </li>
                <li>A permanent partial disability may result in loss of speech, eyesight, loss of a toe or fingers. The
                    insured receives a percentage of the sum assured for a specific time period, or as a lump sum
                    payment.
                </li>
                <li>In case of a permanent total disability, the nominee is entitles to make a claim for the total sum
                    assured.
                </li>
                <li>In case of a temporary total disability like a fracture, the insurer provides a daily or weekly
                    benefit.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>A popular investment option is a Systematic Investment Plan in mutual funds. A small sum is set
                    aside each month which appreciates steadily and over time gives returns sufficient to cover the
                    college expenses of the child. It is very
                    important to shift the corpus to a debt instrument, 3-5 years before the intended goal or target
                    date of the Child’s college education.

                    Education using a Public Provident
                    Fund needs to be started when the child is still young.

            <p>Children Insurance Plans:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Children Insurance Plans are unique and one of a kind. These may be Endowment Plans or Unit Linked
                    Insurance Plans (ULIPs). Just like other Insurance plans, premiums are paid on these plans too.
                    Maturity benefits are paid on the maturity
                    of such plans.
                </li>
                <li>Under Endowment Plans, investment is made in debt instruments and the returns are limited. The bonus
                    accrued is given to the investor. This is a twin benefits plan giving: Insurance + savings.
                </li>
                <li>The parents of the child are the proposer of the Child Endowment Plan. The proposer is also the life
                    assured in the policy. The policy is taken on the life of the proposer in a Child Endowment Plan.
                </li>
                <li>If the proposer/parents dies, then the children get the money for their education (sum assured is
                    paid). But, the plan doesn’t end here. The insurer then funds the policy by paying the remaining
                    premiums. The child endowment policy
                    matures when your child is 18-21 years of age. When the Child Endowment plan matures, the insured
                    gets a second guaranteed lump sum amount which can be used for children’s education. This plan is
                    great because of the twin-payouts.
                </li>
                <li>Under a Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIP), 100% of the amount can be invested either in debt or
                    equity depending on the risk appetite of the investor. Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIP) gives
                    higher returns than Endowment plans. An
                    investor can opt for either of them and even switch between them. ULIPs have a compulsory 5 year
                    lock-in.
                </li>

            <h5>Waiver of the premium rider in the Child Endowment Plan:</h5>
            <p>You must opt for a waiver of premium rider in a Child Endowment Plan. A rider is an additional benefit
                that can be obtained by paying a slightly higher premium. If the parent dies before the plan matures, a
                death benefit is paid out immediately.
                The uniqueness of this plan is that all the future premiums are waived off and are paid by the insurer.
                On maturity of these plans, a guaranteed lump sum amount is paid out. The payout happens at two stages:
                one on the death of the
                parent and another on the maturity of the policy.
