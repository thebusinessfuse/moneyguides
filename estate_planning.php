        <h3>Estate Planning</h3>
        <p>An estate planning is the process of planning for the orderly administration and disposition of property
            after the owner dies. Estate planning involves making plans for the transfer of your estate after death.
            Your estate is all the property
            that you own. It can include cash, clothes, jewelry, cars, houses, land, retirement, savings accounts and so
            on. Estate planning India includes making a will, setting up a trust or making a nomination and even life
            insurance. Estate planning
            services in India have gone to a new level videotaping of wills, making of trusts and even a probate (will
            certified in a court) is the new way. Online estate planning such as making of an online will as well as
            transfer of digital assets
            and even email accounts is an important business.

        <div style="padding: 20px; border: 1px solid rgb(219, 209, 209); border-radius: 10px;" id="card">
            <h5>Why is Estate Planning necessary?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>In the absence of a will, the distribution of the estate is governed as per laws of the nation. If
                    you are a Hindu, it is as per Hindu Succession Act 1956. For Christians, Jews and Parsis, it is as
                    per the Indian Succession Act 1925.
                    If you are a Muslim, your property will be divided according to Muslim Personal Law.</li>
                <li>This means that your loved ones might be left out of the disposition of the property and in the
                    worst situation when there is nobody to claim it, the Government becomes the owner of the property.
                    Therefore Estate Planning is very much
                    required as this is ultimately planning for your own assets with the future perspective in mind.
                </li>

            <h5>What are the methods of Estate Planning?</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>Will: In a will, you state how you would like to distribute your assets (land, property, gold, cars)
                    after death. Who should get how much? This is basically what a will is all about.

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You need an executor (someone you trust) to execute the will on your behalf (make sure that your wish is
                honored as you are not around to do the job yourself).

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trust: A trust is used to transfer wealth to your heirs (children). These trusts have to be
                    compulsorily created/registered and governed under the Indian Trusts Act 1882.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>In a trust you (settler) can transfer your movable property such as a car as well as immovable property
                such as property or land to the trustee (person who holds the property on behalf of your
                beneficiary/children). The trustee is the
                executor (manager of the assets) on behalf of your beneficiary and ensures that your wealth reaches the
                beneficiary irrespective of what happens to you. You can transfer shares/mutual funds, fixed deposits,
                cars, land, apartments/house,
                gold, art as well as antiques to the trust.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nomination: If you have a fixed deposit, shares or mutual funds, you need to make a nomination,
                    where you state who will get the money lying in these accounts on your death. The person you appoint
                    is the nominee. The nominee (basically
                    someone you trust) transfers your wealth/investments to your heirs (children). The nominee is not
                    the owner/inheritor of your wealth. He is a protector/trustee of your wealth and makes sure your
                    beneficiaries (heirs) receive the
                    money. Nomination is done mainly for shares/mutual funds, life insurance policies or land and
                    property.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>When you die after making a will your beneficiaries/heirs inherit your property/wealth. The nominee you
                appoint (could be your nephew or a lawyer), serves as a trustee and makes sure your wealth reaches your
                heir. A nominee is not permanent
                and you can change your nominees any number of times. You can appoint your heirs (children) as nominees.
                If your child is a minor and you appoint him as a nominee you need to appoint as assignee who serves as
                a guardian.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whole Life Insurance: If you want to leave a huge legacy for a disabled child you must take up a
                    whole life insurance policy where on the policyholder’s death, the disabled child (beneficiary) gets
                    the sum assured as well as the accrued
                    bonus. If you have a genetic disorder which has a high chance of being passed on to your child then
                    you can opt for a whole life policy where death benefits and an accrued bonus mean a large sum at
                    maturity.
                </li>
            </ul>
