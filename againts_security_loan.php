                    <h5><b>Loan against security</b></h5>
                    <p>The most common loan against security is the loan against shares. In a loan against shares
                        you borrow money
                        from the bank and pledge your shares as a security against the money obtained. This type of
                        a loan is called
                        a secured loan.
                    </p>

                        <b>What is a Loan against security?</b>
                    </h5>
                    <p>Banks bridge the gap between savers/investors and people who are in need of money. Therefore,
                        the primary
                        function of any bank is to accept deposits and sanction loans. Banks collect deposits from
                        customers. These
                        deposits are repayable by
                        the bank at maturity. Banks lend money to borrowers who are in need of money in the form of
                        loans. A loan
                        against security is one such loan. It is a loan sanctioned against a pledge of
                        security/shares in favor of
                        banks.
