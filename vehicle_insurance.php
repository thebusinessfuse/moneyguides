        <h4><b>Vehicle Insurance</b></h4>
        <h5><b>There are thousands of reasons why you should actively protect your car and yourself in india.</b></h5>
        <p>Driving in India is a luxury that thousands of people partake of everyday. It is now quite simple to buy a
            car in the country, and with higher disposable incomes, most households are able to afford more than one car
            too. Having one’s car increases
            one’s mobility and eliminates dependence on public transport. However, driving in India also comes with its
            own perils. We often hear car owners rue traffic indiscipline; lack of legal enforcement by road authorities
            and myriad other complaints
            about that traffic scenario in India. Cases of road accidents and rule – breaking are reported in newspapers
            on a daily basis. Considering these factors, it is important to get car insurance right after one buys a
            car.

        </p>
        <h5><b>We present 5 reasons to get motor insurance in India</b></h5>

        <div id="card"
            style="background-color: rgb(240, 233, 233); padding: 20px; border: 1px solid rgb(219, 209, 209); border-radius: 10px;">
            <p>It pays for damage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Not only are cars expensive, paying for their repairs is costly too. Sometimes, your car may be
                    damaged due to someone else’s negligence. A car colliding with yours or you swerving to avoid a
                    jaywalker and crashing into a wall, or
                    even a stray cricket ball cracking your windshield can set you back by a considerable amount of
                    money. However, if you have car insurance, you need not pay for these repairs by yourself.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>It reduces your liability:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Taking third party liability (TPL) car insurance coverage is mandatory in India. The TPL policy you
                    against the legal ramifications of an accident caused by you. For example, if you happen to cause an
                    accident those results in damages to another person’s
                    property or injuries to another driver/pedestrian, the insurance will pay for their treatment and
                    save you from the legal repercussions of the case.

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>It pays for your hospitalization:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Not every car owner who suffers an accident is fortunate to get away with a few cuts and bruises.
                    Some accidents result in fractures and other serious injuries that require hospitalization. Instead
                    of shelling out the high hospital and treatment costs
                    from your own pocket, you can get your motor insurance to pay these expenses.

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>It costs less when purchases online:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Buying motor insurance online results in lower premiums and hence, a cheaper policy. This is because
                    the insurer has lower operating costs when transacting over the internet, and is happy to pass on
                    the component of money saved on paying commission to
                    a broker to the customer. Buying motor insurance online has other advantages, such as renewing the
                    policy in minutes and paying premiums without any paperwork.

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>It compensates your family after your demise:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The most unfortunate outcome of a road accident is the car owner’s demise. Once the bread – earning
                    policy holder has passed away, it might become difficult for his or her family to sustain its daily
                    life. However, a motor insurance policy can help to
                    pay the family’s expenses after the unfortunate event.
